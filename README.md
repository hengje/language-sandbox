Language Sandbox
================

My sandbox repository to test and learn different programming languages.
The plan is to do that by solving different problems using different languages.

Test problems
-------------

### Pivo
Pivo is a simple (and stupid) drinking game: One person start by saying "1", 
the next person says "2" and the counting continue with the following twist:
For each number that is divisble by 7 (7, 14, 21, ...) or contains a seven 
(7, 17, 27, ...) the word "PIVO" has to be used instead of the actual number.
The first person that hesitates or miss has to drink...  ;-)

The first problem is modeled after this drinking game:
> Write a program that writes every number between 1 and 100, but replace
the numbers divisible by 7 or containing a 7 by the word "PIVO".
